# DiscordLog
Spigot plugin allowing for logging chat and commands for server through webhook (discord).

### Why should I use this plugin?
- To make sure admins don't abuse their power (by logging all executed commands to a public channel)
- Marking coordinates through chat and easy to config.

### Why not a simple log file?
- A Discord channel is easier for everyone to access
- A Discord channel allows for the log to be public
