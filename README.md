Spigot plugin allowing for logging various in-game events to a discord channel. Log anything, ranging from players joining to admins executing commands!

### Why should I use this plugin?
- To make sure admins don't abuse their power (by logging all executed commands to a public channel)
- To publicly shame anyone that kills your pet (by logging all named entity deaths to a public channel)

### Why not a simple log file?
- A Discord channel is easier for everyone to access
- A Discord channel allows for the log to be public

### TODO:
- [X] Change template system to allow for different order and missing arguments
- [ ] Add override system for overriding messages when certain conditions are met
